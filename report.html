            <h2>Evaluation II:</h2>
            <p>One area for improvement could be the optimization of code efficiency. While the code is functional, there may be opportunities to streamline processes and improve performance to enhance user experience.
                also i have not use JavaScript as good as it should be because while implemneting JavaScript i was facing various issues.
                also the toggle button on my homapage could be better.
